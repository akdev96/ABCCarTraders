CS6004ES –Application Development Individual Coursework –(2023/24)
 
This individual coursework requires developing and documenting a small application in C# using an object oriented approach and Visual Studio. Your software artefact must be submitted as a Visual Studio project. It will be assessed using Visual Studio 2015 or any higher version and any features not working in the standard installation of Visual Studio 2015 or any higher version will not be assessed.
The coursework carries 30% of the module mark.

Set:
Submission Deadlines: 16/06/2024
Coursework Submission in-class Demo: 23/06/2024
This individual coursework has 2 parts, both of the soft copies which are to be submitted before 11.59pm on
16/06/2024.
(1)	The software application to be developed in C#
(2)	The documentation in MS Word format.

Please note the rules on plagiarism
The application should be implemented individually. This is not a group/team effort. Any material which is a direct copy from someone else (student or other source) or a close paraphrase/code must be indicated where it is quoted i.e., it must be made clear what material is a quotation or close paraphrase e.g. by showing the text in italics or in quotation marks. It is not sufficient to show the source in a list of references or bibliography. If you are unclear, please discuss your examples with your seminar tutor or the module leader. Plagiarism is a serious offence and conviction for plagiarism may lead to suspension from the University, even for a first offence (please see the section on Academic Misconduct in the Student Handbook).

Deliverables


Your submission should include the software project and a reflective essay as described below.
1.	Your software artefact in the form of a Visual Studio 2015 project, which should include the program’s source code, compiled classes, the executable file and data file (if any).
2.	A reflective essay (1000 or more words), which concisely documents:
a.	Detailed instructions to run the program
b.	The architecture of your software in terms of software classes, clearly indicating which classes to be of your own work and which classes from other sources (e.g. From textbooks, online sources such as MSDN etc.).
